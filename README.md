# Math10_FinalProject


1.Implement the codes of logistics regression for classification problems by using Numpy (A library for Python).  
2.Implement the codes for Principle Component Analysis.  
3.Use Scikit Learn package for supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods: k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).  
4.Use cuML and TensorFlow packages to accelerate the machine learning program by GPU.
